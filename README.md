### Hi there! I’m Olle.

I currently work as the lead network engineer at Northvolt and focus mostly on network infrastructure, data center, and system integration. I've worked in all things computer networking such as ISP networks, modern data center fabrics, firewalls and distributed office networks.  
  
My main area of expertise is network automation and large scale network deployments and monitoring. I also have extensive experience in data center networking and security.  

If you'd like to reach out I'm available on Linkedin.
